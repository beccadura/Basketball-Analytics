Basketball Analytics Project
Drake University

This project was created by the Computer Science Department at Drake University to help analyze the chemistry between groups of players on the Men's Basketball Team at Drake University.

There are two different folders in this repository:
1. One_Game
2. Last_Five_Games_In_One_Season

The 'One-Game' folder contains the code to display the group of players with the maximum value of a specific statistic (i.e. points scored) within one game.

The 'Last_Five_Games_In_One_Season' contains the code to display the aggregated value of a specific statistic (i.e. points scored) for each group of players that was on the court at any point in time within the last five home or away games (home/away is specificed by the user) of a specified season (i.e. 2017-2018).
