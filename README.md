Basketball Analytics Project

This project was created by the Computer Science Department at Drake University to help analyze the chemistry between groups of players on the Men's Basketball Team at Drake University.

There are three different folders in this repository:
1. One_Game
2. Last_Five_Games_In_One_Season
3. One_Game_Python_Only

The 'One-Game' folder contains the code to display the group of players with the maximum value of a specific statistic (i.e. points scored) within one game on a website using Flask.

The 'Last_Five_Games_In_One_Season' folder contains the code to display the aggregated value of a specific statistic (i.e. points scored) for each group of players that was on the court at any point in time within the last five home or away games (home/away is specificed by the user) of a specified season (i.e. 2017-2018) on a website using Flask.

The 'One_Game_Python_Only' folder contains the code to print out all groups of players that played together during a game and various statistics for each group of players in Python.  It does not incorporate the Flask website at all.
