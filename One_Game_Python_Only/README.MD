Below are the instructions to run this code:

1. Install Python (I use version 3.6) and Pycharm Community Edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac) on your computer.
2. Pull the One_Game_Python_Only folder from GitHub onto your personal computer.  **Note: If you do not know how to do this, it is probably easier for you to just watch a tutorial on YouTube instead of me attempting to type it out.
3. In PyCharm, create a new project from the One_Game_Python_Only folder that should now be on your computer.
4. With the new PyCharm project open, go to the settings.  In Settings, click on the Project Interpreter.  There should be a dropdown menu where you can select the version on Python you downloaded on your computer.
5. Then, also in the Project Interpreter, there should be a plus sign button you can click to install new packages within the project.  Click on that button, and install the following packages: urllib3, re, bs4, lxml.
6. Click Run, and try to run the 'One_Game_Python' file in Pycharm.  **Note: This is the main file that will always be run.  The other files within this folder all get imported into this file; they are just separated to better organize the project.
